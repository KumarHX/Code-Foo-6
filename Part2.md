* Total length of Bridge including approaches from abutment to abutment, plus the distance to the Toll Plaza, is 9,150 ft.
* Length of suspension span including main span and side spans is 1.2 miles (6,450 ft or 1,966 m).
* Length of main span portion of suspended structure (distance between towers) is 4,200 ft (1,280 m).
* Width of Bridge is 90 ft (27 m).
* Width of sidewalk is 10 ft (3 m).

![Towers](http://www.goldengatebridge.org/photos/images/painters_skybox2.jpg)

* The Golden Gate Bridge has two main cables which pass over the tops of the two 746-ft-tall towers.
* Diameter of one main cable including the exterior wrapping is 36 3/8 in (0.92 m).
* Length of one main cable is 7,650 ft (2,332 m).

####Lego Brick Researched Data:
#####(Going to use only the standard 2 by 4 brick for construction)
![bricks](http://freedom-muse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lego-Brick.jpg)

* The length of a standard lego brick is 31.8 mm.
* The height of a standard lego brick is 9.6 mm.
* The width of a standard lego brick is 15.8 mm.

####Calculations:

####Bridge to bricks:

* Total length of Bridge is 9,150 ft. This length covered by the standard lego brick would take 2,788,920 mm which is roughly 87,702 bricks.
* The length of the suspension span including main span and side spans is 6,450 ft or 1,965,960 mm which would take 61,822 bricks.
* Length of main span portion of suspended structure (distance between towers) is 4,200 ft or 1,280,160 mm which is rougly 40,256 bricks.
* Width of Bridge is 90 ft or 27,432 mm which is rougly 863 bricks. 
* Width of sidewalk is 10 ft or 3048 mm which is rougly 96 bricks.
* Total length of bridge times width of bridge = 75,686,826 bricks adding the sidewalk gives another 8,419,392 bricks for a total of:

######84,106,218 bricks for the bridge.

####Main towers to bricks:
* The height of a tower above roadway is 500 ft or 152,400 mm. This is roughly 4793 bricks. 
* Tower base dimension (each leg) is 33 ft x 54 ft or 10,059 mm x 17460 mm. This gives 175,630,140 mm for the base structurem or 5,522,960 bricks. The base structure times the height leaves us with 26,471,547,280 bricks multiplied by two for two towers resulting in:

######52,943,094,560 bricks for the towers.

####Cables to bricks:
* Diameter of one main cable including the exterior wrapping is 0.92 m or 920 mm. This would take about 29 bricks.
* Length of one main cable is 7,650 ft or 2,331,720 mm. This would take about 73,325 bricks multiplied by the diameter results in:

######2,126,425 bricks for the cables.

#####Total : Bridge (84,106,218 bricks) + towers (52,943,094,560 bricks) + cables (2,126,425 bricks) 

##Answer: 53,029,327,203 standard lego bricks.
