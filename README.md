# IGN Code-Foo 6

***Pranav Kumar***

##Part 1:

Take a short video (no more than 5 minutes) introducing yourself, showing your passion for IGN, and telling us why we should pick you to participate in IGN's Code-Foo program. Upload it to YouTube and send us the link.

##Part 2:

The Avengers just made a surprise visit to San Francisco. How many legos would it take to rebuild the Golden Gate Bridge? Describe each step in your thought process.

#####Solution:

##Part 3:

Write a program that determines the best Scrabble™ word from a list of letters. You can use this list of words as your data source or pick a public API like this one: dictionaryapi. Scrabble™ letter values can be found here.

#####Solution: [Source](https://github.com/KumarHX/Code-Foo-6/blob/master/Part%203/ScrabbleWord.java) This program takes a user input (makes sure it is a valid scrabble hand) and finds all the words that can be created based on the wordbase provided by IGN. All the words that can be created based on the hand and the most valuable word (based on letter values and double word score for consecutive letters) are printed to the console. [Test Runs](https://github.com/KumarHX/Code-Foo-6/blob/master/Part%203/TestRun.txt)

#####To Run: cd to Part\ 3 and 

##Part 4 (Backend):

####a:

Aliens have taken your keyboard, and replaced it with an off brand AZERTY keyboard with a sticky 'H' key. Write a program to convert the AZERTY keys you press to QWERTY.

#####Solution: [Source](https://github.com/KumarHX/Code-Foo-6/blob/master/Part%204%20(Backend)/Part%20A/Azerty.java) This program uses a hashmap to map QWERTY values to the representive AZERTY values. The AZERTY keyboard letters are the keys in the hashmap and the QWERTY keyboard letters are the values for the representive keys. [Test Runs]( https://github.com/KumarHX/Code-Foo-6/blob/master/Part%204%20(Backend)/Part%20A/TestRuns.txt)

#####To Run: cd to Part\ 3 and run the command 'java ScrabbleWord' in the terminal

####b:

Write a library from scratch that can parse date strings and convert them to a valid ISO 8601 date/time format. Every value in this list should be supported.

##Bonus:

Programmatically create a card game that uses an AI opponent. The game can be an original creation or it can be modeled after an existing ruleset. Some examples include Black Jack, Poker, Caravan, Gwent, Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity.
